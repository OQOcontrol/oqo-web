    "Each sensor can be programmed to control sound effects, lights, or visuals, and is integrated into a knob with a visual and illuminated position indicator for easier handling. Assigned parameters can be adjusted by turning the knob on its axis or moving it in the air, allowing for direct interaction with the performer’s body.":"Each sensor can be programmed to control sound effects, lights, or visuals, and is integrated into a knob with a visual and illuminated position indicator for easier handling.

    "A distinctive feature of OQO is the ability to connect the knobs to each other using magnets, opening up new possibilities for live control. This allows multiple parameters to be adjusted simultaneously with each hand, offering a novel and creative form of interaction.":"A distinctive feature of OQO is the ability to connect the knobs to each other using magnets, opening up new possibilities for live control.

    "The vertical design of the module promotes a more ergonomic posture, and being completely transparent, it creates no visual barrier between the performer and the audience, allowing for a fluid and direct connection during the performance. All information generated by the knobs is transmitted wirelessly to a computer, synthesizer, or other MIDI-compatible devices.":"The vertical design of the module promotes a more ergonomic posture, and being completely transparent, it creates no visual barrier between the performer and the audience, allowing for a fluid and direct connection during the performance.
